A quick two-hour project for the Boston Computer Graphics meetup on 4/17/2013.

triplehead-base is a project shell for building openFrameworks software installations that show UI on the main screen and video on a Matrox Triplehead.

Does the nontrivial work of making ofApp, ofxFenster, and ofxUI play nicely together.

Dependencies:
* ofxFenster
* ofxUI
* ofxXMLSettings
